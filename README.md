# Object-Oriented Programming 

## Overview

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP): class design and polymorphism. 

1. **Car Class**: A class representing a car with attributes and methods.
2. **Horse Polymorphism Challenge**: A demonstration of polymorphism using different types of horses, each implementing a unique movement method.

## Features

### Car Class

- Defines a `Vehicle` base class with common attributes and methods.
- Implements a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle`, adding specific attributes and methods.
- Includes methods to display car information and honk.

### Horse Polymorphism Challenge

- Defines a base class `Horse` with a method `move()`.
- Implements three subclasses: `Thoroughbred`, `Clydesdale`, and `Pony`, each with its own implementation of the `move()` method.
- Demonstrates polymorphism by calling the `move()` method on different horse objects.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the script files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the scripts are located.
4. Run the Car class script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python car_class.py
